# 💰 Smart Personal Finance Analyzer

A modular, beginner-friendly Python CLI application that helps users manage and analyze their personal financial transactions using CSV files.

This project was created as the Capstone Project for the Code You “Introduction to Python” course, and demonstrates real-world use of core Python concepts including file I/O, functions, lists, dictionaries, modules, conditionals, loops, and error handling.

## ✅ Completed Steps & Features

### ➡️ STEP 1: Project Setup and Initialization
- Created the project structure and folders
- Initialized a Git repository
- Set up a virtual environment
- Created empty Python files for modular development
- Added .gitignore and initial README

### ➡️ STEP 2: Load Transactions and Log Errors
- Implemented `load_transactions()` to read a CSV file into memory
- Used `datetime` for date parsing, and error handling with try-except blocks
- Created `log_error()` logic to write issues to `errors.txt`

### ➡️ STEP 3: Save Transactions to File
- Implemented `save_transactions()` to write the updated transaction list back to the CSV
- Automatically backs up the original file before saving

### ➡️ STEP 4: Add & View Transactions
- `add_transaction()`: lets the user add a new transaction with validation
- `view_transactions()`: displays all current transactions with proper formatting
- `view_transactions_from_file()`: reads directly from the CSV file to display saved transactions

### ➡️ STEP 5: Update & Delete Transactions
- `update_transaction()`: allows users to edit specific fields in a selected transaction
- `delete_transaction()`: deletes a transaction after confirmation

### ➡️ STEP 6: Analyze Financial Data
- `analyze_finances()` calculates and prints:
  - Total credits, debits, and transfers
  - Net balance
  - Breakdown of totals by transaction type

### ➡️ STEP 7: Save and Generate Reports
- `save_transactions()` saves the current in-memory transactions to `financial_transactions.csv`
- Automatically backs up the original CSV (if not already backed up) to `data/backup/`
- `generate_report()` creates a summary report with totals, date range, and timestamp, and saves it to `reports/report_YYYYMMDD.txt`

### ➡️ STEP 8: Monthly Summary
- `calculate_monthly_summary()` calculates and prints monthly totals of:
  - Income (credit)
  - Expenses (debit)
  - Net balance
